# Notes on Lobsters scraper

* basic specs

* we should chat more about where the 'hobos' stuff came from; beginning of April?

* building query strings with concatenation; what about bad chars?

* interesting parallelisms in most methods; could be cleaned up. Incoming data should be normalized in one place

* indentation in `parse_page` not only weird but deceptive

* remnants of refactors; consider `Lobsters::API#frontpage`

* why aren't hobos available on Heroku?
